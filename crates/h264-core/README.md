# H.264 core

Rust H.264 decoding and low-delay desktop encoding used by OpenUUYC.

- Decoder: progressive 8-bit I/P pictures, CAVLC/CABAC, 4:2:0 and 4:4:4.
- Encoder: low-delay desktop video with bitrate/frame-rate updates and keyframe requests.
- Portable DSP with runtime-selected SSE2, SSSE3 and AVX2 implementations.
